# AntiNekoError
Mitigates KanColle NekoError due to network errors


# How to usage

1. Edit the contents of `config.py` on demand. (If you don't need access through a proxy, Please leave the `"client_proxy"` option blank.)
2. install `pycrypto` in server & client.
3. `python3 server.py` on server and `python3 client.py` on client. (Or you can use `screen` to stay in the background on server.)
4. I recommend you use the `Poi browser` to play the KanColle.

# Attention! If you live in mainland China, Please use Client proxy of other proxy soft and setting obfs plugin.
